=== Should have ===
* User authentication for map/list. Assosiate with "secrets" from admin?
* Get maps over to SSL, to avoid "mixed content" warning when on SSL.

* Whitelist for reporting (based on secret).
* Avatars / logos. Need logo for main site, icon for type (car/boat/person/laptop/container/phone/unknown).
* Color based on battery?
* Show speed/bearing if in motion.
* Color (in list?) based on age of request.

=== 2.0 ===
* Consider using http://symfony.com/ for further development.
