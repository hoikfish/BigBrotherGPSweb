== TODOs ==

=== Should have ===
* User authentication for map/list. Assosiate with "secrets" from admin?
* Get maps over to SSL, to avoid "mixed content" warning when on SSL.
* Clean basic map view.

=== Nice to have ===
* Whitelist for reporting (based on secret).
* Avatars / logos. Need logo for main site, icon for type (car/boat/person/laptop/container/phone/unknown).
* Color based on battery?
* Show speed/bearing if in motion.
* Color (in list?) based on age of request.
* Make geoloc zooming in map optional.
* Heatmap for user (shows good parking spots, daily routines, etc)
* Go back in time and show patterns for users per day?

=== 2.0 ===
* Consider using http://symfony.com/ for further development.
