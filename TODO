== TODOs ==


=== Must have ===
* Show tags on map markers (name, date). Will do this with OpenLayers if possible, mapbox or Google if not.

=== Should have ===
* Optional authentication for map/list.
* Get maps over to SSL, to avoid mixed content warning when on SSL.

=== Nice to have ===
* Whitelist for reporting (based on secret).
* Avatars / logos. Need logo for main site, icon for type (car/boat/person/laptop/container/phone/unknown).
* Color based on battery?
* Show speed/bearing if in motion.
* Geolocation of map viewer ( http://openlayers.org/en/v3.0.0/examples/geolocation-orientation.html )


== Features wanted in the App ==

=== Must have ===

=== Should have ===
* Option to report more often if in motion.
* Other optimizations to limit battery usage?

=== Nice to have ===
* Read return codes after post. I.e. "You've been stolen. Report more often.", "Please snap a pic and upload".
